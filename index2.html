    <p class="p1">Nike’s new CEO Elliott Hill stepped into his new role on October 14 facing a complex, intertwined number of challenges, not least of which is restoring the company to growth mode after dropping 10% in revenues in its most recent quarter and seeing its stock price plunge nearly 30% this year.

        In this Olympic year, Nike’s fortunes should be rising. Nike president of consumer, product and brand Heidi O’Neill told Reuters, “This Olympics will be our biggest. This will be the most investment and the biggest moment for Nike in years.”
        
        However, Nike’s Olympic big-moment backfired. Its brand reputation started to tank immediately after the Olympics, according to RepTrak, a corporate reputation tracking company and advisor on brand reputation.</p>
